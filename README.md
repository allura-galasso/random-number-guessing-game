# Random Number Guessing Game
Welcome to my random number guessing game !!

You can download the python file and play on your own device/terminal !
Hope you have so much fun playing, this is my first published project !

Here are the rules: 

1. Choose your difficulty level. You can choose from easy (where you'll pick a number between 1 and 50), medium (where the numbers are between 1 and 100), hard (where the numbers are between 1 and 500), or insane (where numbers are between 1 and 1000).

2. Try to guess the number I'm thinking of.

3. You only have 10 attempts to guess the number

4. If you want a hint, type 'hint' to see the range of the number. If you use your hint, you will lose one attempt.

5. Once you've finished playing you can enter your name and save your score to the leaderboard for your level of difficulty! If you've played more than once youre only able to put your name in if you have scored better than your previous score.

Good luck !
